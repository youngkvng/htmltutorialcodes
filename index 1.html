        <!-- first sons bestie/crush or to be girlfriend-->
        <p>I actually have a female bestie whom i like ,her name is CHIOMA. although she do call me her <abbr title="bestie">best</abbr>
           but seriously speaking , i dont believe her words. I first became friends with her younger sister 
           but after sometime it became an old story for us. But now as am speaking , i am seriously crushing on a pretty
           fair girl also living close to them. Though i have not the opportunity to disclose my feelings for her
           but i pray that one day i will be able to do so.</p><a href="images/002.jpg"><img src="images/002.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="BESTIE">.</a>
